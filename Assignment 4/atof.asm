;Function information
;   Function name: atolong
;   Programming language: X86
;   Language syntax: Intel
;   Function prototype:  long int atof (char * number_string);
;   Reference: None
;   Input parameter: The char array passed to this function must contain valid integral data.
;   Output parameter: A long integer that is faithfully represented by the incoming parameter.

;Assemble: nasm -f elf64 -o atof.o -l atof.lis atof.asm

;Names
;   The function "atof" was intended to be called atol, however there already is a function in the C++ standard library
;   with that name.  To avoid any possible conflict this function received the longer name, namely: atolong.  A simple web
;   search will produce lots of information about the original atol.
