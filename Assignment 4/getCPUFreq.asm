;Extract data from processor in the form of two 4-byte strings
mov rax, 0x0000000080000004

;Answer is in ebx:eax as big endian strings using the standard ordering of bits.
mov       r15, rbx      ;Second part of string saved in r15
mov       r14, rax      ;First part of string saved in r14


;Catenate the two short strings into one 8-byte string in big endian
and r15, 0x00000000000000FF    ;Convert non-numeric chars to nulls
shl r15, 32
or r15, r14                    ;Combined string is in r15

;Use of mask: The number 0x00000000000000FF is a mask.
;In general masks are used to change some bits to 0 (or 1) and leave others unchanged.


;Convert string now stored in r15 to an equivalent IEEE numeric quadword.
